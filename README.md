 # 📌 Unsupervised Learning 🎯  

This repository contains a collection of **unsupervised learning projects** leveraging machine learning techniques such as **clustering, dimensionality reduction and 
recommendation system**. These projects are designed to extract meaningful insights from unlabeled data using algorithms like **K-Means, Apriori, PCA, Cosine Similarity**, etc.  

## 🚀 Projects Included  
✅ **Clustering:** Customer segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation  
✅ **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA, SVD, ICA for high-dimensional data visualization  
✅ **Recommendation System:** Content-based-recommendation-engine for Relevant Products and 
                               Collaborative-Recommendation-Engine for Similar Customers.  
✅ **Association Rule Mining:** Market basket analysis using Apriori
